# DA-Essentials
The following is a sample project repository that was created using a template. 


1.- Project title: The name of the project and a brief description of the main goal and purpose of the project.
2.- Demo link: If you have a working demo of the project, provide the link so that readers can see your project in action.
3.- Table of contents (optional): If the project has sections, a table of contents can be generated from the section titles. In this raw text example, the section titles are proceeded by the ## characters.
4.- Business Understanding: Your description of the goals and purpose for the project. In this section, you should explain a little about what you wanted to accomplish, why you selected this analysis project, and any challenges that you faced while working through the project.
5.- Data understanding: Explain your data sources and why you chose the particular data sets that you did. You can also discuss additional enhancements or analysis that you want to perform in the future.
6.- Screenshots of visualizations\Results: Examples of the process or outputs. In analytics, these can be images of visualizations.
7.- Technologies: List all of the technologies you used to complete the project, to show your proficiency with these tools.
8.- Setup: Instructions on how to set up or install the environment and any dependencies that are required. This section can also include usage instructions for readers who want to duplicate your results.
9.- Approach: For analytics projects, this section describes the process and the types of analysis utilized to obtain the data, prepare and clean it, and to test the outcomes.

Process: 

A.- Asking the Question - The analytics process always starts with a question to be answered. Some questions are simple, such as “which bicycle color is most popular with our younger buyers?” Others are very complex, such as “why are certain types of cancer cells exhibiting resistance to radiation treatments?”
B.- Getting the data - This step involves the process of locating and obtaining data that is relevant to the question, and then determining if there is enough data to complete the analysis.
Investigating the data - Data comes in many forms and from many different sources. This step involves determining if the data is complete and contains the relevant information for the analysis.
C.- Preparing the data - This step can involve many tasks to transform the data into a format appropriate for the tools that will be used to analyze and present the data. This process is sometimes referred to as “cleaning” the data, because there may be blank records or obvious errors in the data set.
D.- Analyzing the data - Analysis is the process of identifying patterns, correlations, and relationships contained within a data set or sets to draw inferences and conclusions. Often, analysis relies on statistical techniques and software tools such as spreadsheets and visualization applications.
E.- Presenting the results - This is usually the last step for data analysts. It is the process of communicating the results to decision-makers. This can be done in the form of a report, graphical representations, or a combination of both. Sometimes the data analyst is also asked to recommend actions based on results.

Types of Analysis:

A.- Descriptive analytics asks, “What happened?”
B.- Predictive analytics asks, “What might happen in the future?”
C.- Prescriptive analytics asks, “What should be done next?”
D.- Diagnostic analytics asks, “Why did this happen?”


10.- Status: The current status of the project. In most cases, you will be putting information into the repository while you are working on the project, so the status will be “in process” and, later, “complete/released”. If there are multiple versions of your project, you can indicate the version here, as well.
11.- Credits: List of individuals or organizations that contributed or provided assistance to you while you created the project. You can also list sites that provided inspiration or feedback.
